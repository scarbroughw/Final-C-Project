# Final-C-Project

This is my final project for my C programming class
What this program is, is a stat inputting, stat outputting program.
An unspecified sport has 6 teams playing against each other.
The program asks for each team's score per game and calculates who won,
how many goals for and against in the season, and even includes a prediction algorithm
to predict the possible winner of two teams given the season's stats.
